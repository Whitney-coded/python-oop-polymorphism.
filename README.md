# Python OOP Project: Classes, Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Description

This project demonstrates key OOP concepts in Python:

- Creating classes with attributes and methods.
- Using constructors to initialize objects.
- Implementing inheritance to build class hierarchies.
- Demonstrating polymorphism with a shared method (`move()`) behaving differently in subclasses.
- Encapsulation by using private attributes and getter/setter methods.
